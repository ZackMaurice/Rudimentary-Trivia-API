If the client inputs an invalid query, the server will not respond with questions.
-> responds with status 1, and the reason for that status

-> with status 1 and 2, server always tells the client why it failed	(Not enough questions, invalid token, invalid parameters)

Running instructions:
open cmd
type:
	node requestServer.js

go to localhost:3000 on browser of choice
